## Dependencies

**RAFFAELLO.js** has a depedency to the amazing [cropper.js](https://github.com/fengyuanchen/cropperjs/), a custom library by **Fengyuan Chen**. This library makes for the input images to be able to crop them.

The dependency is already bundled within the `.min.js` and `.min.css` files.


## Basic usage

The typical worklfow to use RAFFAELLO is:
1. Load RAFFAELLO in your HTML.
1. Add all the necessary `Inputs` in your HTML page. 
2. Add a JS `<script>` or load it. In this script you need to
    - Setup an instance of **RAFFAELLO**, which is equivalent to declaring the final `Canvas`.
    - Link all the HTML `Inputs` to the JS variables to make the images.
    - Draw on the `canvas`, with successives `Layers`.
    - Link the `Inputs` changes to specific `Layers` to be redrawn.
